## IELTS Preparation 
### It is like reinventing the wheel. But, I am sharing what I have used. 

### Create a sheet like below  and keep recording your practice results at home.  Practice should be time-bound like an actual exam. 
### After every practice test, cross-check and work on your limitations.

### This image is my actual progress tracker from the year 2022.

### Speaking 
- Record yourself and listen

### Listening 
- Listen to native morning shows on TV
- Start practicing 

### Writing 
- Do at least two practice tasks 1 every day
- Do at least one task 2 every day
- Type your task 2 in a Grammarly-like platform and cross-check and re-do the same task  [at least I did it] 

### Reading 
- Read books written by native writers.
- Read the opinion article.
- Read whatever you can.


### A few uTube channels will help you a lot
